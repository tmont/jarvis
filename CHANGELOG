1.1 2011-05-27
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- correctly print the plural or singular form of "assertion"
	- use \r instead of \n on IE for failure/error messages
- Enhancements
	- added Jarvis.summary()
	- added Jarvis.reset() to reset the global assertionCount variable
	- prettier output using CSS3 (TEXT SHADOW! DROP SHADOW!)
	- bundled diff_match_patch.js in jarvis-min.js
	- bundled sizzle.js in jarvis-min.js
	- bundled stacktrace.js in jarvis-min.js
	- new assertions
		- Is.inDom: determine if a node is present in the DOM
		- Has.text: make an assertion about the text of a DOM node
		- Has.flattenedText: make an assertion about the recursively retrieved text of a DOM node
	- added stack trace output for failures/errors for HtmlReporter
	- added global option Jarvis.showStackTraces to switch stack trace output on and off. The default
	  is on, and is only rendered when using the HtmlReporter. This option is disabled for Opera, because
	  it's insanely slow.
- Breaking changes
	- Contains became Has
	- Contains.not became Has.no
	- Jarvis.reporter became Jarvis.defaultReporter
	- second argument to Jarvis.run() is an optional reporter to use for that test; falls back to
	  Jarvis.defaultReporter if not given
	- Jarvis.collapsedByDefault is gone
	- HtmlReporter takes an object as an optional second argument for defining options. The only relevant 
	  property now is collapsedByDefault, which defaults to true.
